This is a shell script for an automated build of the latest version of Python 3 (3.4.1) on the latest LTS version of Ubuntu (14.04). All prerequisite software is installed and all default Python features are enabled.

This build was created and tested on [Ubuntu's own Vagrant box, available at vagrantbox.es](http://www.vagrantbox.es/), though it should work in all Ubuntu 14.04 environmens.
